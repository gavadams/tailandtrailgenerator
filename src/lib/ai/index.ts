${request.cityArea ? `ðŸš¨ CRITICAL AREA REQUIREMENT ðŸš¨
You MUST create a pub crawl route that stays EXCLUSIVELY within the ${request.cityArea} area of ${request.city}. 
- Do NOT select pubs from other neighborhoods or areas
- Do NOT use pubs from city center, downtown, or other districts
- ALL pubs must be located specifically in ${request.cityArea}
- If you cannot find enough pubs in ${request.cityArea}, reduce the number of pubs rather than using pubs from other areas
- This is a HARD REQUIREMENT that cannot be ignored` : ''}

CRITICAL: Use REAL, ESTABLISHED pub crawl routes from online sources, travel guides, and local recommendations. Do NOT create fictional routes or pubs. Research actual pub crawl routes that are documented and popular in the specified area.

CRITICAL STORY & PUZZLE REQUIREMENTS:

STORY EXCELLENCE:
1. Create a COMPELLING MYSTERY with clear stakes, motivation, and emotional investment
2. Develop MEMORABLE CHARACTERS with distinct personalities, motivations, and backstories
3. Build TENSION and SUSPENSE throughout - each location should escalate the mystery
4. Use authentic local knowledge about ${request.city} - real landmarks, history, culture, geography
5. Create STRONG NARRATIVE BRIDGES between locations that advance the plot meaningfully
6. Include specific local references that players can research, visit, or recognize
7. Balance challenge with accessibility for ${request.difficulty} difficulty level

PUZZLE EXCELLENCE:
8. Design puzzles that are INTRINSICALLY CONNECTED to the story - not just random challenges
9. Each puzzle should REVEAL NEW INFORMATION about the mystery or characters
10. Create PROGRESSIVE DIFFICULTY with increasing complexity and sophistication
11. Ensure each puzzle type is UNIQUE and uses different cognitive skills
12. Make clues CONTEXTUAL and MEANINGFUL - they should feel natural to the story
13. Include MULTIPLE LAYERS of puzzle solving (observation + deduction + local knowledge)
14. Design puzzles that encourage TEAMWORK and DISCUSSION among players
15. AVOID generic puzzles - make each puzzle SPECIFIC to the location, story, and characters
16. Create puzzles that require players to think creatively and make connections
17. Ensure puzzles have clear, unambiguous answers that can be verified
18. Make puzzles engaging and fun, not frustrating or overly complex

WALKING ROUTE REQUIREMENTS:
15. ${request.cityArea ? 
    `ðŸš¨ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT ðŸš¨: You MUST research and use REAL, ESTABLISHED pub crawl routes from ${request.cityArea} in ${request.city}. 
    - Do NOT create fictional routes
    - Do NOT use pubs from other areas like city center, downtown, or other neighborhoods
    - Focus EXCLUSIVELY on ${request.cityArea}
    - ALL selected pubs must be within this specific neighborhood/area
    - If you cannot find enough pubs in ${request.cityArea}, use fewer pubs rather than expanding to other areas
    - This requirement is NON-NEGOTIABLE` : 
    `CRITICAL: You MUST research and use REAL, ESTABLISHED pub crawl routes from ${request.city}. Do NOT create fictional routes. Use your knowledge of actual pub crawl routes that are popular online, in travel guides, or local recommendations. Consider factors like: city center accessibility, transportation hubs, popular nightlife districts, historic areas, waterfront locations, and university areas.`
  }
16. RESEARCH REAL PUB CRAWLS: Use established pub crawl routes that are documented online, in travel blogs, local guides, or tourism websites
17. AUTHENTIC PUBS ONLY: Choose real, existing pubs that are part of known pub crawl routes in the area
18. PROVEN ROUTES: Prefer routes that are already popular and well-documented rather than creating new ones
19. WALKING DISTANCE: Ensure walking distance between consecutive pubs is 5-15 minutes (0.3-1.2 miles)
20. AREA CHARACTER: Consider the area's character - historic districts, waterfront, university areas, business districts, etc.
21. PUB VARIETY: Include variety in pub types (traditional, modern, gastropub, etc.) along the established route
22. NATURAL FLOW: Make the route feel natural and enjoyable to walk, following established patterns
23. ${!request.cityArea ? 'When no specific area is defined, use your knowledge of the most popular and well-documented pub crawl routes in the city.' : ''}

ADVANCED PUZZLE TYPES TO USE:
- logic: Complex logical reasoning, syllogisms, conditional statements, logical sequences
- observation: Environmental storytelling, hidden details, visual pattern recognition, spatial reasoning
- cipher: Multi-layer encryption, historical ciphers, substitution codes, frequency analysis
- deduction: Evidence correlation, timeline reconstruction, motive analysis, alibi verification
- local: Deep local knowledge, historical events, architectural details, cultural references
- wordplay: Sophisticated anagrams, cryptic clues, linguistic patterns, etymology puzzles
- math: Mathematical reasoning, geometric patterns, statistical analysis, algorithmic thinking
- pattern: Complex sequence recognition, fractal patterns, recursive logic, system analysis

PUZZLE COMPLEXITY EXAMPLES:
- EASY: Simple word puzzles, basic math, obvious observations
- MEDIUM: Multi-step logic, pattern recognition, local knowledge application
- HARD: Complex ciphers, advanced deduction, sophisticated mathematical reasoning

HIGH-QUALITY PUZZLE EXAMPLES:
- A cipher puzzle where the key is hidden in the pub's historical architecture
- A logic puzzle that reveals a character's alibi through timeline reconstruction
- An observation puzzle where players must notice specific details in the pub's decor
- A local knowledge puzzle about the city's history that connects to the mystery
- A mathematical puzzle that calculates distances or times relevant to the case
- A wordplay puzzle using local dialect or historical language
- A deduction puzzle where players must cross-reference witness statements
- A pattern puzzle that reveals a hidden message in the pub's layout or design
- A local knowledge puzzle about the area's famous residents or events
- A logic puzzle involving the pub's history or previous owners

STORY EXCELLENCE EXAMPLES:
- Characters with hidden motivations that are revealed through puzzle solutions
- Plot twists that make players reconsider earlier clues and evidence
- Emotional stakes that make players care about the outcome
- Local history that becomes crucial to solving the mystery
- Red herrings that mislead but don't frustrate players
- Satisfying resolutions that tie all loose ends together

REAL PUB CRAWL ROUTE EXAMPLES TO RESEARCH:
- Popular routes from travel blogs (Time Out, Lonely Planet, local tourism sites)
- Established pub crawl companies and their documented routes
- Local newspaper articles about pub crawls and bar hopping
- Tourism board recommendations for pub crawls
- University pub crawl routes and student recommendations
- Historic pub trails and heritage pub routes
- Food and drink tour company routes
- Local bar association or pub guide recommendations

FINAL CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST use REAL, ESTABLISHED pub crawl routes from online sources, travel guides, and local recommendations. Do NOT create fictional routes or pubs. Research actual pub crawl routes that are documented and popular in the specified area. This is essential for creating an authentic and practical experience.

${request.cityArea ? `ðŸš¨ AREA-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION ðŸš¨: You are creating a pub crawl for ${request.cityArea} in ${request.city}. Do NOT use generic default pubs that are commonly used regardless of area. Instead, research actual pubs that are specifically located in ${request.cityArea} and are part of real pub crawl routes for that area. Only use pubs that are genuinely in ${request.cityArea}, not pubs from other areas that are commonly used as defaults.` : ''}
