  }
16. RESEARCH REAL PUB CRAWLS: Use established pub crawl routes that are documented online, in travel blogs, local guides, or tourism websites
17. AUTHENTIC PUBS ONLY: Choose real, existing pubs that are part of known pub crawl routes in the area
18. PROVEN ROUTES: Prefer routes that are already popular and well-documented rather than creating new ones
19. WALKING DISTANCE: Ensure walking distance between consecutive pubs is 5-15 minutes (0.3-1.2 miles)

${request.cityArea ? `ðŸš¨ AREA-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION ðŸš¨: You are creating a pub crawl for ${request.cityArea} in ${request.city}. Do NOT use generic default pubs that are commonly used regardless of area.
